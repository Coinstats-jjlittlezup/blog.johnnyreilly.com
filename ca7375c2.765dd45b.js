Sebastian wrote a blog post documenting a good solution to the ASP.NET JavaScriptSerializer DateTime problem at the tail end of last year.

I thought it was worth documenting this, hence this post, but just so I'm clear; the hard work here was done by Sebastian Markb\xe5ge and Nathan Vonnahme and not me.

I digress...) Because it can make debugging a much more straightforward process I place a lot of value on being able to read the network traffic that web apps generate. It's much easier to drop into Fiddler / FireBug / Chrome dev tools etc and watch what's happening there and then instead of having to manually process the data separately first so that you can understand it. I think this is nicely aligned with the ",Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"},"KISS principle"),". For that reason I've been generally converting DateTimes to ISO 8601 strings on the server before returning them to the client. A bit of extra overhead but generally worth it for the gains in clarity in my opinion. So I was surprised and delighted when I happened upon ",Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://blog.calyptus.eu/seb/2011/12/custom-datetime-json-serialization/"},"Sebastian Markb\xe5ge's blog post")," which provided a DateTime JavaScriptConverter that could be plugged into the JavaScriptSerializer. You can see the code below (or on Sebastian's original post with a good explanation of how it works): ",Object(r.b)("script",{src:"https://gist.github.com/2489976.js?file=DateTimeJavaScriptConverter.cs"})),Object(r.b)("p",null," Using this converter meant that a DateTime that previously would have been serialised as ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'"\\/Date(1293840000000)\\/"')," would now be serialised as ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'"2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000Z"')," instead. This is entirely agreeable because 1. it's entirely clear what a ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'"2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000Z"')," style date represents and\n2. this is more in line with native browser JSON implementations and ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"&lt;statingTheObvious&gt;"),"consistency is a good thing.",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"&lt;/statingTheObvious&gt;")),Object(r.b)("h2",{id:"getting-your-web-services-to-use-the-iso-8601-datetime-converter"},"Getting your web services to use the ISO 8601 DateTime Converter"),Object(r.b)("p",null,"Sebastian alluded in his post to a ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"web.config")," setting that could be used to get web services / pagemethods etc. implementing his custom DateTime serialiser.

This lead me to using Nathan Vonnahme's ISO 8601 JavaScript Date parser, the code of which is below (or see his original post ",Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://n8v.enteuxis.org/2010/12/parsing-iso-8601-dates-in-javascript/"},"here"),"): ",Object(r.b)("script",{src:"https://gist.github.com/2489976.js?file=parseISO8601Date.js"})),Object(r.b)("p",null," With this in place I could parse ISO 8601 Dates just like anyone else.

",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'parseISO8601Date("2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000Z")')," would give me a JavaScript Date of ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Sat Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 2011"),". Obviously in the fullness of time the parseISO8601Date solution should no longer be necessary because ",Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://es5.github.com/#x15.9.3.2"},"EcmaScript 5 specifies an ISO 8601 date string constructor"),". However, in the interim Nathan's solution is a lifesaver.

Based on what I've read ",Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az4se3k1.aspx#Roundtrip"},"here")," I think it would be possible to amend Sebastians serializer to fall in line with IE 9's pendantry by changing this: ```cs\nreturn new CustomString(((DateTime)obj).ToUniversalTime()"),Object(r.b)("p",null,"  .ToString(",Object(r.b)("b",null,'"O"'),")"),Object(r.b)("p",null,");"),Object(r.b)("pre",null,Object(r.b)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"\n To this: ```cs\nreturn new CustomString(((DateTime)obj).ToUniversalTime()\n\n  .ToString(<b>\"yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'.'fffzzz\"</b>)\n\n);\n")),Object(r.b)("p",null," I've held off from doing this myself as I rather like Sebastian's idea of being able to use Microsoft's Round-trip (\"O\", \"o\") Format Specifier. And it seems perverse that we should have to move away from using Microsoft's Round-trip Format Specifier purely because of (Microsoft's) IE! But it's a possibility to consider and so I put it out there. I would hope that MS will improve their JavaScript Date constructor with IE 10. A missed opportunity if they don't I think. ## PPS Just when you thought is over... IE 9 was right!"),Object(r.b)("p",null,"Sebastian got in contact after I first published this post and generously pointed out that, contrary to my expectation, IE 9 technically had the correct implementation.

On reflection this does rather make sense as the result of a ",Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"JSON.stringify(new Date())"),' never results in an ISO date string to the 10 millionths of a second detail.
