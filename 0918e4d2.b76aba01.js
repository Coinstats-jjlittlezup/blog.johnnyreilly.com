I originally wrote this back in 2013 and at the time used NuGet for both server and client side package management. I decided to migrate it to use Bower for the client side packages (which I planned to combine with a Gulp script which was going to pull out the required JS / CSS etc as needed). However it wasn't the plain sailing I'd imagined. The actual switchover from NuGet to Bower was simple. Just a case of removing NuGet packages and adding their associated Bower counterpart. The problem came when the migration was done and I hit \"compile\".
