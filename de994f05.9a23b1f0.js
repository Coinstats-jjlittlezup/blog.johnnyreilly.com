Clearly that's invalid for our remote example given that a username could be \"claimed\" at any time; eg in between people first entering their username (when validation should have fired automatically) and actually submitting the form.

It's important to note that I have set up a method that takes 3 inputs; UserName, which is supplied by default as the UserName input is the one which is decorated with remote validation attributes as well as the 2 extra inputs of FirstName and LastName. In the example I've given I don't actually need these extra attributes. I'm doing this because I know that I have situations in remote validation where I ","*",Object(o.b)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"need"),"*"," to supply multiple inputs and so essentially I did it here as a proof of concept. The addition of these 2 extra inputs was achieved through the use of the ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"data-val-remote-additionalfields")," attribute. When searching for documentation about this I found absolutely ",Object(o.b)("u",null,"none"))),Object(o.b)("p",null,". I assume there is some out there - if anyone knows then I'd very pleased to learn about it. I only learned about it in the end by finding an example of someone using this out in the great wide world and understanding how to use it based on their example. To understand how the ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"data-val-remote-additionalfields")," attribute works you can look at jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js. If you're just looking to get up and running then I found that the following works: ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'data-val-remote-additionalfields="*.FirstName,*.LastName"')," You will notice that: - Each parameter is supplied in the format ",Object(o.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"*",".","[InputName]"),' and inputs are delimited by ","\'s - Name is a ',Object(o.b)("u",null,"required")),Object(o.b)("p",null," attribute for an input if you wish it to be evaluated with unobtrusive validation. (Completely obvious statement I realise; I'm writing that sentence more for my benefit than yours) - Finally, our validation always fails. That's deliberate - I just wanted to be clear on the approach used to get remote unobtrusive validation with extra parameters up and running.\n4. Using ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"setInterval")," we intend to trigger the ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"pendingValidationComplete")," function to check if remote validation has completed every 50ms - again I try to avoid setInterval wherever possible but this seems to be the most sensible solution in this case.\n5. When the remote request finally completes (ie when ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"pendingRequest")," has a value of 0) then we can safely proceed on the basis of our validation results.
