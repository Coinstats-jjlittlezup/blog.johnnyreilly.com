For those of you that don&#x27;t know JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is lightweight text based data interchange format. Rather than quote other people verbatim you can find thorough explanations of JSON here: - <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing JSON</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.json.org/js.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON in Javascript</a></li></ul><p> As mentioned in my previous <a href="http://icanmakethiswork.blogspot.com/2012/02/potted-history-of-using-ajax-on.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Ajax</a> I came upon JSON quite by accident and was actually using it for some time without having any idea. But let&#x27;s pull back a bit. Let&#x27;s start with the JavaScript Object Literal. Some years ago I came upon this article by Christan Heilmann about the JavaScript Object Literal which had been published all the way back in 2006: <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2006/02/16/show-love-to-the-object-literal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Show love to the JavaScript Object Literal</a> Now when I read this it was a revelation to me. I hadn&#x27;t really used JavaScript objects a great deal at this point (yes I am one of those people that started using JavaScript without actually learning the thing) and when I had used them is was through the <code>var obj = new Object()</code> pattern (as that&#x27;s the only approach I knew). So it was wonderful to discover that instead of the needlessly verbose: ```js
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.wheels = 4;
myCar.colour = &quot;blue&quot;;</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1zKU"><div class="codeBlockContent_actS"><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_tuNs thin-scrollbar"><div class="codeBlockLines_3uvA" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block">
</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"> I could simply use the much more concise object literal syntax to declare an object instead: ```js</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">var myCar = { wheels: 4, colour: &quot;blue&quot; };</span></div></div></div><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_2GIj">Copy</button></div></div><p> Lovely. Henceforth I adopted this approach in my code as I&#x27;m generally a believer that brevity is best. It was sometime later that I happened upon JSON (when I started looking into <a href="http://icanmakethiswork.blogspot.com/2012/01/jqgrid-its-just-far-better-grid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jqGrid</a>). Basically I was looking to pass complex data structures backward and forward to the server and, as far as I knew, there was no way to achieve this simply in JavaScript. I was expecting that I would have to manually serialise and deserialise (yes dammit I will use the English spellings!) objects when ever I wanted to do this sort of thing. However, I was reading the the fantastic Dave Ward&#x27;s <a href="http://encosia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Encosia</a> blog which on this occasion was talking about the <a href="http://encosia.com/why-aspnet-ajax-updatepanels-are-dangerous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">troubles of UpdatePanels</a> (a subject close to my heart by the way) and more interestingly the use of PageMethods in ASP.NET. This is what he said that made me prick up my ears: <em>&quot;Page methods allow ASP.NET AJAX pages to directly execute a pageâ€™s static methods, using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is basically a minimalistic version of SOAP, which is perfectly suited for light weight communication between client and server.&quot;</em> JSON is a lightweight SOAP eh? I&#x27;ve used SOAP. I wonder if I could use this.... To my complete surprise, and may I say delight, I discovered that a wonderful fellow called Douglas Crockford, he of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript, The Good Parts</a> fame had quietly come up with JSON some time ago. JSON, from my perspective, turned out to be a simple way to turn an object into a string and then from a string back into an object. So simple that it consists of 2 methods on a JSON object: - JSON.stringify(myObject) - take an object and make me a JSON string. (and by the way isn&#x27;t &quot;stringify&quot; just the loveliest method name ever?)</p><ul><li>JSON.parse(myJSONString) - take a JSON string and make me an object</li></ul><p>Let me illustrate the above method names using the myCar example from earlier: ```js
var myCar = { wheels: 4, colour: &quot;blue&quot; };
// myCar is an object</p><p>var myCarJSON = JSON.stringify(myCar);
//myCarJSON will look like this: &#x27;{&quot;wheels&quot;:4,&quot;colour&quot;:&quot;blue&quot;}&#x27;</p><p>var anotherCarMadeFromMyJSON = JSON.parse(myCarJSON);
//anotherCarMadeFromMyJSON will be a brand new &quot;car&quot; object</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1zKU"><div class="codeBlockContent_actS"><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_tuNs thin-scrollbar"><div class="codeBlockLines_3uvA" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block">

</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"> Crockford initially invented/discovered JSON himself and wrote a little helper library which provided a JSON object to be used by all and sundry. This can be found here: [JSON on GitHub](&lt;https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js&gt;) Because JSON was so clearly wonderful, glorious and useful it ended up becoming a part of the EcmaScript 5 spec (in fact it&#x27;s worth reading the brilliant [John Resig&#x27;s blog post](&lt;http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/&gt;) on this). This has lead to JSON being offered [natively in browsers](&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Native_encoding_and_decoding_in_browsers&gt;) for quite some time. However, for those of us (and I am one alas) still supporting IE 6 and the like we still have Crockfords JSON2.js to fall back on.</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block">

It was an <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET WebForms</a> project and for some time we&#x27;d been using what was essentially a glorified <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.datagrid.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datagrid</a> which had a few extra features implemented to allow us to change column order / columns displayed / copy contents to clipboard etc. Our grid worked perfectly fine - it gave us the functionality we needed. However, it looked pretty terrible, and had some &quot;quirky&quot; approaches in place for supporting IE and Firefox side by side. Also, at the time we were attempting to make our app seem new and exciting again for the users. The surprising truth is that users seem to be more impressed with a visual revamp than with new or amended functionality. So I was looking for something which would make them sit up and say &quot;oooh - isn&#x27;t it pretty!&quot;. Unfortunately the nature of the organisation I was working for was not one that lended itself to paying for components. They were occasionally willing to do that but the hoops that would have to be jumped through first, the forms that would need to be signed in triplicate by people that had nearly nothing to do with the project made that an unattractive prospect. So I began my search initially looking at the various open source offerings that were around. As a minimum I was looking for something that would do what our home-grown component did already (change column order / columns displayed / copy contents to clipboard etc) but hopefully in a &quot;nicer&quot; way. Also, I had long been unhappy with the fact that to get our current grid to render results we did a *<strong>full postback</strong>* to the server and re-rendered the whole page. Pointless! Why should you need to do all this each time when you only wanted to refresh the data? Instead I was thinking about using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ajax</a> approach; a grid that could just get the data that it needed and render it to the client. This seemed to me a vastly &quot;cleaner&quot; solution - why update a whole screen when you only want to update a small part of it? Why not save yourself the trouble of having to ensure that all other screen controls are persisted just as you&#x27;d like them after the postback? I also thought it was probably something that would scale better as it would massively reduce the amount of data moving backwards and forwards between client and server. No need for a full page life cycle on the server each time the grid refreshes. Just simple data travelling down the pipes of web. With the above criteria in mind I set out on my Google quest for a grid. Quite soon I found that there was a component out there which seemed to do all that I wanted and far more besides. It was called <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jqGrid</a>: <img src="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/jqgrid%2Bin%2Ball%2Bits%2Bglory-5e4ec2bcc3e2f23d46aa8860469d07a1.png"></p><p> Oooh look at the goodness! It had both column re-ordering and column choosing built in!: This was a *<strong>very promising sign</strong>*! Now it&#x27;s time for me to demonstrate my ignorance. According to the website this grid component was a &quot;jQuery plugin&quot;. At the time I read this I had no idea what jQuery was at all - let alone what a plugin for it was. Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to get diverted so let&#x27;s just say that reading this lead to me getting an urgent education about some of the client side aspects of the modern web that I had been previously unaware of. I digress. This component did exactly what I wanted in terms of just sending data down the pipe. jqGrid worked with a whole number of possible data sources; XML, Array but the most exciting for me was obviously <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON</a>. Take a look a the grid rendered below and the JSON that powered it (all from a simple <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/server.php?q=2&amp;_search=false&amp;nd=1326531357333&amp;rows=10&amp;page=1&amp;sidx=id&amp;sord=desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GET</a> request): <img src="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/Check%2Bout%2Bthe%2BJSON-700afd2766cc157bb1b2153f022303f3.png"></p><p> As you can see from the above screenshot, the grid has populated itself using the results of a web request. The only information that has gone to the server are the relevant criteria to drive the search results. The only information that has come back from the server is the data needed to drive the grid. Simple. Beautiful. I loved it and I wanted to use it. So I did! I had to take a few steps that most people thinking about using a grid component probably wont need to. First of all I had to write an ASP.Net WebForms wrapper for jqGrid which could be implemented in a similar way to our current custom datagrid. This was because, until the users were convinced that the new grid was better than the old both had to co-exist in the project and the user would have the option to switch between the two. This WebForms wrapper plugged into our old school XML column definition files and translated them into JSON for the grid. It also took <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.dataset.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datasets</a> (which drove our old grid) and translated them into jqGrid-friendly JSON. I wanted to power the jqGrid using WebMethods on ASPX&#x27;s. After a little digging I found <a href="http://encosia.com/using-jquery-to-directly-call-aspnet-ajax-page-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Ward of Encosia&#x27;s post</a> which made it very simple (and in line with this I switched over from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GET_%28HTTP%29#Request_methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GET</a> requests to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POSTs</a>). Finally I wrote some custom javascript which added a button to jqGrid which, if clicked, would copy the contents of the jqGrid to the clipboard (this was the only bit of functionality that didn&#x27;t appear to be implemented out of the box with jqGrid). I think I&#x27;m going to leave it there for now but I just wanted to say that I think jqGrid is a fantastic component and it&#x27;s certainly made my life better! It&#x27;s: - well supported, there is lots on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jqgrid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow</a> and the like about it</p><ul><li>there are regular <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases / upgrades</a></li><li>there are good online <a href="http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonstrations</a> and <a href="http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a></li></ul><p> I think Tony Tomov (the man behind jqGrid) has come up with something truly brilliant. It&#x27;s worth saying that the equally brilliant jQueryUI team are in the process of writing an official <a href="http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery UI grid component</a> which uses jqGrid as one of its inspirations. However, this is still a long way from even a &quot;zero feature&quot; release. In the meantime jqGrid is continuing to go from strength to strength and as such I heartily recommend it. Finally, you can take a look at jqGrid&#x27;s source on <a href="https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/jqgrid">jqgrid</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/ajax">ajax</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/jquery">jquery</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/datagrid">datagrid</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/dave-ward">Dave Ward</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/json">json</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/no-postback">no postback</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/encosia">Encosia</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tags/tony-tomov">tony tomov</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about jqGrid - it&#x27;s just a far better grid" href="/blog.johnnyreilly.com/2012/01/14/jqgrid-its-just-far-better-grid"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 John Reilly.
