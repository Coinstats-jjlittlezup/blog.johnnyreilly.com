I was back working on a project which had a Coded UI test suite. I\u2019d heard tell that there were problems with the tests and was just taking a look at them. The first hurdle I fell at was getting the tests to run locally. The tests had first been developed on a standard desktop build and, as much as this can ever be said of Coded UI tests, they worked. However, the future had happened. The company in question was no longer using the old school desktop towers. Nope, they\u2019d reached for the sky and equipped the whole office with Surface Pro 3\u2019s, hot desks, docking stations and big, big monitors.

Most tests need the ability for users to click on buttons, dropdowns etc. That\u2019s part of a normal UI. And so it was with these tests. This is where they fell over. The reason they fell over at this point didn\u2019t become clear for a while. It wasn\u2019t until we tried tweaking our implementation of the tests that we realised what was happening. The tests normally found buttons / dropdowns etc on the screen and then attempted to perform a ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Mouse.Click")," upon them. We changed the implementation to be subtly different. Instead of just clicking on the element we amended the test to move the mouse to the button and then perform the click."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Aha!"),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Rather than steadily moving towards an element and clicking, the pointer was swerving like a drunk man crossing the road at 3am.
