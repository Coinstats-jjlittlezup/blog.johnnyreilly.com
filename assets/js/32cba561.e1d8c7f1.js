I feel a little wary about recommending this as a solution for a variety of not particularly defined reasons. However, I have to say I've found this pretty stable and reliable.

Anyway..."),Object(r.b)("p",null,"There isn't actually a great deal to say about this WCF service. It should (hopefully) just do what it says on the tin.

This is commonly employed when people want to expose a RESTful WCF service. The reason I\'ve used this binding is I wanted a simple "in" when calling the service. I wanted to be able to call the service via AJAX as well as directly by browsing to the service and supplying a URL-encoded URL like this:'),Object(r.b)("p",null,Object(r.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"http://localhost:59002/PdfMaker.svc/GetPdf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com/"),"You may wonder why I'm using ",Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://news.ycombinator.com"},"http://news.ycombinator.com")," for the example above.

These should probably be POST operations as they create a new resource each time they're hit. However, if they were I wouldn't be able to just enter a URL into a browser for testing and that's really useful. So tough, I shake my fist at the devotees of pure REST on this occasion.
