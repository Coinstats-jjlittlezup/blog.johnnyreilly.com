Before discussing how ts-loader handles this, it\u2019s helpful to review at a really basic level what ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"tsc")," itself does here. If you were to run ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"tsc")," on this tiny example project, the build would fail with the error:"),Object(a.b)("pre",null,Object(a.b)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-sh"},"error TS6305: Output file 'lib/niftyUtil.d.ts' has not been built from source file 'lib/niftyUtil.ts'.\n")),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Using project references actually instructs ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"tsc"),Object(a.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not")," to build anything that\u2019s part of another project from source, but rather to look for any ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".d.ts")," and ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".js")," files that have already been generated from a previous build. Since we\u2019ve never built the project in ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"lib")," before, those files don\u2019t exist, so building the root project fails. Still just thinking about how ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"tsc")," works, there are two options to make the build succeed: either run ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"tsc -p lib/tsconfig.json"),Object(a.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"first"),", or simply run ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"tsc --build"),", which will figure out that ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"lib")," hasn\u2019t been built and build it first for you."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Ok, so how is that relevant to ts-loader?
