The common advice handed out in this situation is: \"add unit tests before you change it\". That's good advice. We need to take the implementation that embodies the correctness of the system and create unit tests that set that implementation in stone. However, what say the system that you're hoping to add tests to takes a number of large and complex inputs from some external source and produces a similarly large and complex output?"),Object(o.b)("p",null,"You could start with integration tests. They're good but slow and crucially they depend upon the external inputs being available and unchanged (which is perhaps unlikely). What you could do (what I have done) is debug a working working system.

There comes a point when this is plainly untenable; it's just too much data to transcribe. At this point the temptation is to think \"it's okay; I can live without the tests.
