When our users log into our application, they are redirected to a shared login provider which, upon successful authentication, hands over a cookie containing auth details and redirects back to our application.

As an experiment we tried setting the response header to ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Content-Type: text/html"),". It worked!
